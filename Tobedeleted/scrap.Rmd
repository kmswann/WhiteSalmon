## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
month.flow.prepost <- ws %>%
               filter(Date>="2003-10-01") %>%
               group_by(Month) %>%
               summarise('2- 2003 to 2019' = mean(Flow, na.rm=T)) %>%  
               round(3)

#create dataframe and bind 3 tables together
month.flow <- as.data.frame(cbind(month.flow.historic, 
                                  month.flow.prepost[, 2], # only add second column
                                  month.flow.pre[, 2], 
                                  month.flow.post[, 2])) 
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

#Create a summed month flow. 
month.flow <- ws %>% 
  group_by(WaterYear,WaterYFS, Year, Month) %>% 
  summarise(Total_cfs = sum(Flow, na.rm=T), n=n()) %>%  
  round(3)
#turn the summed month flow into drataframe 
month.flow <- as.data.frame(month.flow)
#fix the dates up for seasonal work
month.flow$Date <- as.Date(paste(month.flow$Year, month.flow$Month, 1, sep="-"), format = "%Y-%m-%d")

#create a summed annual flow. 
annual.flow <- ws %>%
  group_by(WaterYear,WaterYFS) %>%
  summarise(Total_cfs = sum(Flow, na.rm=T), n=n()) %>%  round(3)
#turn summed annual flow into dataframe
annual.flow <- as.data.frame(annual.flow);  
#remove those missing more than 10%
annual.flow <- subset(annual.flow, n>=330)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
